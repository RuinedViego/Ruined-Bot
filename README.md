What the hell is Ruined Bot:
Ruined bot is a pixel bot for League Of Legends released on the 31 July 2021 patch 11.15, written in C# .NET using image processing (image & text recognition), Inter-op and scripting engine.
The Beta testing is free for all users we will soon be releasing the official version of it which would be a paid one at a reasonable price for sure.

What on earth does Ruined Bot do:
It's a good way to raise your account level 30 without having to play or simply to win blue essences. Sit in the back and watch him farming :pick: smurf accounts.

                            :repeat: Loop  :repeat:

Why is the official version going to be a paid one ?
Currently the beta version is the fastest free leveling up bot on the internet let me explain:
To reach level 30 in league, players must obtain a combined total of 37,392 experience points.
The average XP per Bot-intermediate game is around 150, you’re looking at about 250 games, a bot game averages 20mins long which means
3 games per hour, in other terms that would be 72 games per day. 250/72 is an average of three and a half days. (all of the calculations excluded the xp boosts you get for free in game). The premium version will include Aram and Blindpick game-modes which means more Xp in less time.

‼️ **The most important step is to make sure both the configuration files are set to your riot games path, this is for the beta testing only: **
("E:/Games/RiotGames") could be edited with any kind of notepads.

-The last step is to make sure that you always start the program as an administrator 👔 otherwise it won't function properly.
-Launch the RuinedBot.exe file as an administrator, Have fun and enjoy the account farming  (⊙o⊙)
 :KataLove:
-In case you want to switch from the different bot game modes just go to the patterns folder, StartCoop, change the BotIntermediate variable with BotIntro or BotBeguinner.
