What the hell is Ruined Bot:
Ruined bot is a pixel bot for League Of Legends released on the 31 July 2021 patch 11.15, written in C# .NET using image processing (image & text recognition), Inter-op and scripting engine.
The Beta testing is free for all users we will soon be releasing the official version of it which would be a paid one at a reasonable price for sure.

What on earth does Ruined Bot do:
It's a good way to raise your account level 30 without having to play or simply to win blue essences. Sit in the back and watch him farming :pick: smurf accounts.

                            :repeat: Loop  :repeat:

Why is the official version going to be a paid one ?
Currently the free version is the fastest free leveling up bot on the internet let me explain:
To reach level 30 in league, players must obtain a combined total of 37,392 experience points.
The average XP per Bot-intermediate game is around 150, you’re looking at about 250 games, a bot game averages 20mins long which means
3 games per hour, in other terms that would be 72 games per day. 250/72 is an average of three and a half days. (all of the calculations excluded the xp boosts you get for free in game). The premium version will include Aram and Blindpick game-modes which means more Xp in less time.

# Setting Up:

‼️ **The most important step is to make sure both the configuration files are set to your riot games path: **
Open config and paste your league directory.
("E:/Games/RiotGames")
("E:/Games/RiotGames/lockfile") could be edited with any kind of notepads.

-The last step is to make sure that you always start the program as an administrator 👔 otherwise it won't function properly.
-Launch the RuinedBot.exe file as an administrator, Have fun and enjoy the account farming >;)

Nothing works?!
Make sure to right click on the bot launch icon, go to propreties then compatibility setting and make sure to run it as windows7 compatibility!!
otherwide run the bot on a virtual machine with windows 7 installation and .NET framework 4.8 installed
